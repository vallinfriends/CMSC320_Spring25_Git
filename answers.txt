Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging creates a new commit that inherits changes from both the main and feature branches. Rebasing rewrites changes on the feature branch so that they are "moved" to the end of the main branch. Merging is safer because it is non-destructive, but rebasing is cleaner because it makes history linear.
